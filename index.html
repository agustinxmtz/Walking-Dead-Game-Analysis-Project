                    In each episode, the player controls a main character as the story unfolds through various scenes. Players can explore the environment, examine items, and engage in conversations with non-player characters, choosing from several response options, including the choice to remain silent. Some scenes feature quick time events, where players must press specific buttons to respond to on-screen prompts. Failing to do so in time may result in the character's death or an undesirable outcome, causing the game to restart from the previous scene.

                    The game excels at forcing players to make tough decisions on the spot while also allowing moments to pause and reflect. It encourages you to see things from Lee's perspective, considering various circumstances. For example, when deciding whether to spare or kill Andy, players have real agency in shaping the outcome.  <br> "In games, choices with these components(Awareness, Gameplay consequences, Reminders, and Permanence) will evoke a strong emotional reaction, something that players discuss and think about and remember. By making choices meaningful, we help to make the game itself meaningful"<br>

                    The Walking Dead resonates with me on a deeper level because I have a daughter the same age as Clementine. As I play, I feel a fatherly instinct to protect her, and my decisions reflect what I would do if she were my own daughter. This perspective adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the game, making the story even more compelling as I want to protect, love, and understand all the unique characters.
